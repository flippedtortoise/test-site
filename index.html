    <p> Hi, my name is Noah. I really enjoy playing video games such as <a href="https://terraria.org/"> <strong>Terraria</strong> </a>
        and <a href="https://www.gearboxpublishing.com/game/risk-of-rain-2/"> <strong>Risk of Rain 2 </strong></a> . I also enjoy skateboarding, hanging out with friends
        and talking to my girlfriend Emily on the phone. Some of my favorite people are 
        <div> In order my favorite people are</div>
        <ol> 
            <li> Emily </li>
            <li> Emir </li>
            <li> Freddy </li>
        </ol>
        But theyre all pretty close in comparison, I love all of them just about equally
